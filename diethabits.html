       <h2>Diet and Habits</h2>
       <p>The diet of zebras mainly consists of grass. Shrubs, twigs, bark and leaves are also a part of their diet. Their digestive system and metabolism are such that they can thrive on a low-nutrition diet. They can digest coarse grasses which other herbivores can't. Thus zebras help other wild grazers by consuming coarse grass and leaving softer grass for them. They grip the grass with their lips and bite it off with their front teeth. They use their molars to grind the food.</p>
       <p>Zebras tend to remain in the proximity of water holes. Typically, they seek green pastures. During the dry months they thrive on dry grass. They inhabit grasslands, the savannas, as also the coastal, hilly or mountainous regions. Zebras have a large appetite. They spend almost 60% of the time of their day eating. They eat tall grasses growing in wet soils. When food is scarce, about 80% of their time is spent eating.</p>
